游리 What is HTML Links ?

    游댖HTML links are hyperlinks.
    游댖You can click on a link and jump to another document.
    游댖When you move the mouse over a link, the mouse arrow will turn into a little hand.

    游댮Note: A link does not have to be text. A link can be an image or any other HTML element!

游리 HTML Links - Syntax

    For example:

        <a href="url">link text</a>

        游댖The most important attribute of the <a> element is the href 
            attribute, which indicates the link's destination.
        游댖The link text is the part that will be visible to the reader.
        游댖Clicking on the link text, will send the reader to the specified URL address.

        <a href="https://www.amazon.in/">Visit Amazon India!</a>

游리 HTML Links - The target Attribute

    游댖By default, the linked page will be displayed in the current browser 
        window. To change this, you must specify another target for the link.
    游댖The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document.
    游댖The target attribute can have one of the following values:

        _self - Default. Opens the document in the same window/tab as it was clicked
        _blank - Opens the document in a new window or tab
        _parent - Opens the document in the parent frame
        _top - Opens the document in the full body of the window

            For example:

                <a href="https://www.amazon.in/" target="_blank">Visit Amazon India!</a>

游리 Absolute URLs vs. Relative URLs

    游댖Both examples above are using an absolute URL (a full web address) in the href attribute.
    游댖A local link (a link to a page within the same website) is 
        specified with a relative URL (without the "https://www" part):

        For example:

            <h2>Absolute URLs</h2>
            <p><a href="https://www.amazon.in/">Amazon</a></p>
            <p><a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a></p>

            <h2>Relative URLs</h2>
            <p><a href="html_images.asp">HTML Images</a></p>
            <p><a href="/css/default.asp">CSS Tutorial</a></p>

游리 HTML Links - Use an Image as a Link

    To use an image as a link, just put the <img> tag inside the <a> tag:

        For example:

            <a href="default.asp">
            <img src="smiley.gif" alt="HTML tutorial" style="width:42px;height:42px;">
            </a>

游리 Link to an Email Address

    Use mailto: inside the href attribute to create a link that opens 
    the user's email program (to let them send a new email):

        For example:

            <a href="mailto:someone@example.com">Send email</a>

游리 Button as a Link

    游댖To use an HTML button as a link, you have to add some JavaScript code.
    游댖JavaScript allows you to specify what happens at certain events, such as a click of a button:

        For example:

            <button onclick="document.location='default.asp'">HTML Tutorial</button>

游리 Link Titles

    The title attribute specifies extra information about an element. 
    The information is most often shown as a tooltip text when the mouse moves over the element.

        For example:    

            <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/" title="Go to W3Schools HTML section">Visit our HTML Tutorial</a>

游리 Link Tag 

    游댖The <link> tag defines the relationship between the current document and an external resource.
    游댖The <link> tag is most often used to link to external style sheets or to add a favicon to your website.
    游댖The <link> element is an empty element, it contains attributes only.

        For example: 

            <head>
                <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
            </head>

游리 What is HTML Images ?

    游댖Images can improve the design and the appearance of a web page.
    游댖The HTML <img> tag is used to embed an image in a web page.
    游댖Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are 
        linked to web pages. The <img> tag creates a holding space for 
        the referenced image.
    游댖The <img> tag is empty, it contains attributes only, and does not have a closing tag.
    游댖The <img> tag has two required attributes:

    src - Specifies the path to the image
    alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image 

        For example:

            <img src="url" alt="alternatetext">

游리 The src Attribute

    游댖The required src attribute specifies the path (URL) to the image.
    游댮Note: When a web page loads, it is the browser, at that moment, 
        that gets the image from a web server and inserts it into the page.
        Therefore, make sure that the image actually stays in the same spot
        in relation to the web page, otherwise your visitors will get a 
        broken link icon. The broken link icon and the alt text are shown 
        if the browser cannot find the image.

        For example:

            <img src="img_chania.jpg" alt="">

游리 The alt Attribute

    游댖The required alt attribute provides an alternate text for an image, 
        if the user for some reason cannot view it (because of slow 
        connection, an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses 
        a screen reader).
    游댖The value of the alt attribute should describe the image: 

        For example:

            <img src="img_chania.jpg" alt="Flowers in Chania">

游리 Images in Another Folder
    
    游댖If you have your images in a sub-folder, you must include the folder name in the src attribute:   

        For example:

            <img src="/images/html5.gif" alt="HTML5 Icon" style="width:128px;height:128px;">

游리 Animated Images
    
    HTML allows animated GIFs:

        For example:

            <img src="programming.gif" alt="Computer Man" style="width:48px;height:48px;">

游리 Image as a Link

    To use an image as a link, put the <img> tag inside the <a> tag:

        For example:

            <a href="default.asp">
                <img src="smiley.gif" alt="HTML tutorial" style="width:42px;height:42px;">
            </a>

游리 Image Floating
    
    Use the CSS float property to let the image float to the right or to the left of a text:

        For example:

            <p><img src="smiley.gif" alt="Smiley face" style="float:right;width:42px;height:42px;">
            The image will float to the right of the text.</p>

            <p><img src="smiley.gif" alt="Smiley face" style="float:left;width:42px;height:42px;">
            The image will float to the left of the text.</p>
