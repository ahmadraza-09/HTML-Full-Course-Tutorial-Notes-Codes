🟡 What is HTML class Attribute ?

    🔘The HTML class attribute is used to specify a class for an HTML element.
    🔘Multiple HTML elements can share the same class.

🟡 Using The class Attribute

    🔘The class attribute is often used to point to a class name in a 
    style sheet. It can also be used by a JavaScript to access and 
    manipulate elements with the specific class name.
    🔘In the following example we have three <div> elements with a class 
    attribute with the value of "city". All of the three <div> elements 
    will be styled equally according to the .city style definition in 
    the head section:

    For example:

        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html>
        <head>
            <style>
                .city {
                    background-color: tomato;
                    color: white;
                    border: 2px solid black;
                    margin: 20px;
                    padding: 20px;
                }
            </style>
        </head>
        <body>

        <div class="city">
            <h2>London</h2>
            <p>London is the capital of England.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="city">
            <h2>Paris</h2>
            <p>Paris is the capital of France.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="city">
            <h2>Tokyo</h2>
            <p>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.</p>
        </div>

        </body>
        </html>

🔴 Tip: The class attribute can be used on any HTML element.
🔴 Note: The class name is case sensitive!


🟡 Multiple Classes

    🔘HTML elements can belong to more than one class.
    🔘To define multiple classes, separate the class names with a space, 
    e.g. <div class="city main">. The element will be styled according to 
    all the classes specified.
    🔘In the following example, the first <h2> element belongs to both the 
    city class and also to the main class, and will get the CSS styles from 
    both of the classes: 

    For example:

        <h2 class="city main">London</h2>
        <h2 class="city">Paris</h2>
        <h2 class="city">Tokyo</h2>

🟡 Different Elements Can Share Same Class

    🔘Different HTML elements can point to the same class name.
    🔘In the following example, both <h2> and <p> point to the "city" class 
    and will share the same style:

        For example:

            <h2 class="city">Paris</h2>
            <p class="city">Paris is the capital of France</p>

🟡 What is HTML id Attribute ?

    🔘The HTML id attribute is used to specify a unique id for an HTML element.
    🔘You cannot have more than one element with the same id in an HTML document.

🟡 Using The id Attribute

    🔘The id attribute specifies a unique id for an HTML element. 
    The value of the id attribute must be unique within the HTML document.
    🔘The id attribute is used to point to a specific style declaration in 
    a style sheet. It is also used by JavaScript to access and manipulate 
    the element with the specific id.
    🔘The syntax for id is: write a hash character (#), followed by an id 
    name. Then, define the CSS properties within curly braces {}.
    🔘In the following example we have an <h1> element that points to the 
    id name "myHeader". This <h1> element will be styled according to 
    the #myHeader style definition in the head section:

    For example:

        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html>
        <head>
        <style>
        #myHeader {
        background-color: lightblue;
        color: black;
        padding: 40px;
        text-align: center;
        }
        </style>
        </head>
        <body>

        <h1 id="myHeader">My Header</h1>

        </body>
        </html>

🟡 Difference Between Class and ID

    🔘A class name can be used by multiple HTML elements, while an id name 
    must only be used by one HTML element within the page:

        For example:

            <style>
            /* Style the element with the id "myHeader" */
            #myHeader {
            background-color: lightblue;
            color: black;
            padding: 40px;
            text-align: center;
            }

            /* Style all elements with the class name "city" */
            .city {
            background-color: tomato;
            color: white;
            padding: 10px;
            }
            </style>

            <!-- An element with a unique id -->
            <h1 id="myHeader">My Cities</h1>

            <!-- Multiple elements with same class -->
            <h2 class="city">London</h2>
            <p>London is the capital of England.</p>

            <h2 class="city">Paris</h2>
            <p>Paris is the capital of France.</p>

            <h2 class="city">Tokyo</h2>
            <p>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.</p>
    
🟡 HTML Bookmarks with ID and Links

    🔘HTML bookmarks are used to allow readers to jump to specific parts of a webpage.
    🔘Bookmarks can be useful if your page is very long.
    🔘To use a bookmark, you must first create it, and then add a link to it.
    🔘Then, when the link is clicked, the page will scroll to the location with the bookmark.

        For example:
            <a href="#C4">Jump to Chapter 4</a>
            <h2 id="C4">Chapter 4</h2>
