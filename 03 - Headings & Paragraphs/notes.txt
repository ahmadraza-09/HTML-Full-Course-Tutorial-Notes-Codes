游리 What is HTML Headings ?

    HTML headings are titles or subtitles that you want to display on a webpage.

游리 HTML Headings

    游댖HTML headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags.
    游댖<h1> defines the most important heading. <h6> defines the least important heading.

    <h1>Heading 1</h1>
    <h2>Heading 2</h2>
    <h3>Heading 3</h3>
    <h4>Heading 4</h4>
    <h5>Heading 5</h5>
    <h6>Heading 6</h6>

游리 Why Headings are Important ?

    游댖Search engines use the headings to index the structure and content of your web pages.
    游댖Users often skim a page by its headings. It is important to use headings to show the document structure.
    游댖<h1> headings should be used for main headings, followed by <h2> headings, then the less important <h3>, and so on.

游댮Note: Use HTML headings for headings only. Don't use headings to make text BIG or bold.

游리 Bigger Headings
    
    Each HTML heading has a default size. However, you can specify the size for any heading with the style attribute, using the CSS font-size property.

    for example:

        游댖<h1 style="font-size:60px;">Heading 1</h1>


游리 What is HTML Paragraph ?

    A paragraph always starts on a new line, and is usually a block of text.

游리 HTML Paragraphs

    游댖The HTML <p> element defines a paragraph.
    游댖A paragraph always starts on a new line, and browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph.

    For example:

        游댖<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
        游댖<p>This is another paragraph.</p>

游리 HTML Display

    游댖You cannot be sure how HTML will be displayed.
    游댖Large or small screens, and resized windows will create different results.
    游댖With HTML, you cannot change the display by adding extra spaces or extra lines in your HTML code.
    游댖The browser will automatically remove any extra spaces and lines when the page is displayed:

    For example:

        <p>
            This paragraph
            contains a lot of lines
            in the source code,
            but the browser
            ignores it.
        </p>

        <p>
            This paragraph
            contains         a lot of spaces
            in the source         code,
            but the        browser
            ignores it.
        </p>

游리 HTML Horizontal Rules

    游댖The <hr> tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule.
    游댖The <hr> element is used to separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page:

    For example:

        <h1>This is heading 1</h1>
        <p>This is some text.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>This is heading 2</h2>
        <p>This is some other text.</p>
        <hr>

游리 HTML Line Breaks

    游댖The HTML <br> element defines a line break.
    游댖Use <br> if you want a line break (a new line) without starting a new paragraph:    

    For example:

        游댖<p>This is<br>a paragraph<br>with line breaks.</p>

游리 The Poem Problem
    
    This poem will display on a single line:

    For example:

        <p>
        My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

        My Bonnie lies over the sea.

        My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

        Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
        </p>

游리 Solution - The HTML <pre> Element

    游댖The HTML <pre> element defines preformatted text.
    游댖The text inside a <pre> element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), and it preserves both spaces and line breaks:

    For example:

        <pre>
        My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

        My Bonnie lies over the sea.

        My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

        Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
        </pre>
