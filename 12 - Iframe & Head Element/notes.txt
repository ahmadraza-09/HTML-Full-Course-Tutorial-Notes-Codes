游리 What is HTML Iframes ?

    An HTML iframe is used to display a web page within a web page.

游리 HTML Iframe Syntax

    游댖The HTML <iframe> tag specifies an inline frame.
    游댖An inline frame is used to embed another document within the current HTML document.

        For example:

            <iframe src="url" title="Deal Share"></iframe>
        
        游댮 Tip: It is a good practice to always include a title attribute 
        for the <iframe>. This is used by screen readers to read out what 
        the content of the iframe is.

游리 Iframe - Set Height and Width

    游댖Use the height and width attributes to specify the size of the iframe.
    游댖The height and width are specified in pixels by default:

        For example:

            <iframe src="demo_iframe.htm" height="200" width="300" title="Iframe Example"></iframe>

游리 Iframe - Remove the Border

    游댖By default, an iframe has a border around it.
    游댖To remove the border, add the style attribute and use the CSS border property:

    For example:    

        <iframe src="demo_iframe.htm" style="border:none;" title="Iframe Example"></iframe>

游리 Iframe - Target for a Link

    游댖An iframe can be used as the target frame for a link.
    游댖The target attribute of the link must refer to the name attribute of the iframe:

    For example:

        <iframe src="demo_iframe.htm" name="iframe_a" title="Iframe Example"></iframe>
        <p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com" target="iframe_a">W3Schools.com</a></p>

游리 HTML - The Head Element

    The HTML <head> element is a container for the following elements: 
    <title>, <style>, <meta>, <link>, <script>, and <base>.

游리 The HTML <head> Element

    游댖The <head> element is a container for metadata (data about data) 
    and is placed between the <html> tag and the <body> tag.
    游댖HTML metadata is data about the HTML document. Metadata is not displayed.
    游댖Metadata typically define the document title, character set, styles, 
    scripts, and other meta information.

游리 The HTML <title> Element

    The <title> element defines the title of the document. The title must be text-only, and it is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab.
    The <title> element is required in HTML documents!
    The content of a page title is very important for search engine optimization (SEO)! The page title is used by search engine algorithms to decide the order when listing pages in search results.
    
    The <title> element:
    defines a title in the browser toolbar
    provides a title for the page when it is added to favorites
    displays a title for the page in search engine-results
    So, try to make the title as accurate and meaningful as possible!

    A simple HTML document:

    For example:

        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html>
        <head>
        <title>A Meaningful Page Title</title>
        </head>
        <body>

        The content of the document......

        </body>
        </html>

游리 The HTML <style> Element

    The <style> element is used to define style information for a single HTML page:

    For example:

        <style>
            body {background-color: powderblue;}
            h1 {color: red;}
            p {color: blue;}
        </style>

游리 The HTML <link> Element

    游댖The <link> element defines the relationship between the current document and an external resource.
    游댖The <link> tag is most often used to link to external style sheets:
    
    For example:

        <link rel="stylesheet" href="mystyle.css">

游리 The HTML <meta> Element

    游댖The <meta> element is typically used to specify the character set, 
    page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings.
    游댖The metadata will not be displayed on the page, but is used by 
    browsers (how to display content or reload page), by search engines 
    (keywords), and other web services.

    For example:

        游댖Define the character set used:
        <meta charset="UTF-8">

        游댖Define keywords for search engines:
        <meta name="keywords" content="HTML, CSS, JavaScript">

        游댖Define a description of your web page:
        <meta name="description" content="Free Web tutorials">

        游댖Define the author of a page:
        <meta name="author" content="John Doe">

        游댖Refresh document every 30 seconds:
        <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="30">

        游댖Setting the viewport to make your website look good on all devices:
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

游리 Setting The Viewport

    游댖The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page. It varies with the device - it will be smaller on a mobile phone than on a computer screen.
    游댖You should include the following <meta> element in all your web pages:

        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    
    游댖This gives the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling.
    游댖The width=device-width part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device).
    游댖The initial-scale=1.0 part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.
