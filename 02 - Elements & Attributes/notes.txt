游리 Elements

游리 What is an Element ?

    An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag.

    for example:
    <tagname>Content goes here...</tagname>

游리 Examples of some HTML elements 

    <h1>My First Heading</h1>
    <p>My first paragraph.</p>
    <br>
    <hr>

游댮Note: Some HTML elements have no content (like the <br> element). 
        These elements are called empty elements. Empty elements do not have an end tag!

游리 Nested HTML Elements

    游댖HTML elements can be nested (this means that elements can contain other elements).
    游댖All HTML documents consist of nested HTML elements.
    游댖The following example contains four HTML elements (<html>, <body>, <h1> and <p>).

游리 Empty HTML Elements

    游댖HTML elements with no content are called empty elements.
    游댖The <br> tag defines a line break, and is an empty element without a closing tag:

游리 HTML is Not Case Sensitive

    游댖HTML tags are not case sensitive: <P> means the same as <p>.


游리 Attributes

游리 What is an Attribute ?

    HTML attributes provide additional information about HTML elements.

游리 HTML Attributes
    
    游댖All HTML elements can have attributes
    游댖Attributes provide additional information about elements
    游댖Attributes are always specified in the start tag
    游댖Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"

    for example:
        
        游리 href Attribute
        游꿢<a href="https://www.google.com">Visit Google</a>
        游댖The <a> tag defines a hyperlink. The href attribute specifies 
            the URL of the page the link goes to Google

        游리 src Attribute
        游꿢<img src="animal.jpg">
        游댖The <img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page. 
           The src attribute specifies the path to the image to be displayed

        游리 Width and Height Attributes
        游꿢<img src="img_girl.jpg" width="500" height="600">
        游댖The <img> tag should also contain the width and height attributes, 
            which specify the width and height of the image (in pixels):

        游리 alt Attribute
        游꿢<img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl with a jacket">
        游댖The required alt attribute for the <img> tag specifies an 
           alternate text for an image, if the image for some reason 
           cannot be displayed. This can be due to a slow connection, 
           or an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen
           reader.

        游리 style Attribute
        游꿢<p style="color:red;">This is a red paragraph.</p>
        游댖The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, 
           such as color, font, size, and more.


游리 The lang Attribute

    You should always include the lang attribute inside the <html> tag, 
    to declare the language of the Web page. This is meant to assist 
    search engines and browsers.

        for example:

            <!DOCTYPE html>
            <html lang="en">
            <body>
            ...
            </body>
            </html>

    Country codes can also be added to the language code in the 
    lang attribute. So, the first two characters define the language
    of the HTML page, and the last two characters define the country.

        for example:

            <!DOCTYPE html>
            <html lang="en-IN">
            <body>
            ...
            </body>
            </html>

游리 The title Attribute

    The title attribute defines some extra information about an element.
    The value of the title attribute will be displayed as a tooltip 
    when you mouse over the element:

        for example:

            <p title="I'm a tooltip">This is a paragraph.</p>
