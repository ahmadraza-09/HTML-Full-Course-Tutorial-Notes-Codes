游리 What is HTML Block and Inline Elements

    Every HTML element has a default display value, depending on what 
    type of element it is.
    The two most common display values are block and inline.

游리 Block-level Elements

    游댖A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers 
        automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.
    游댖A block-level element always takes up the full width available 
        (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).
    游댖Two commonly used block elements are: <p> and <div>.
    游댖The <p> element defines a paragraph in an HTML document.
    游댖The <div> element defines a division or a section in an HTML document.
    游댖The <p> element is a block-level element.
    游댖The <div> element is a block-level element.

        For example:

            <p>Hello World</p>
            <div>Hello World</div>

游리 Inline Elements

    游댖An inline element does not start on a new line.
    游댖An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.
    游댖This is a <span> element inside a paragraph.

        For example:

            <span>Hello World</span>

游댮 Note: An inline element cannot contain a block-level element!

游리 The <span> Element

    游댖The <span> element is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.
    游댖The <span> element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common.
    游댖When used together with CSS, the <span> element can be used to style parts of the text:

        For example:

            <p>My mother has <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold;">blue</span> 
            eyes and my father has <span style="color:darkolivegreen;font-weight:bold;">
            dark green</span> eyes.</p>     

游리 What is HTML Div Element ?

    The <div> element is used as a container for other HTML elements.

游리 The <div> Element

    The <div> element is by default a block element, meaning that it takes 
    all available width, and comes with line breaks before and after.

        For example:

            Lorem Ipsum <div>I am a div</div> dolor sit amet.

游리 <div> as a container

    The <div> element is often used to group sections of a web page together.

    For example:

        <div>
            <h2>London</h2>
            <p>London is the capital city of England.</p>
            <p>London has over 13 million inhabitants.</p>
        </div>

游리 Center align a <div> element
    
    If you have a <div> element that is not 100% wide, and you want to 
    center-align it, set the CSS margin property to auto.
    
        For example:

            <style>
                div {
                    width:300px;
                    margin:auto;
                }
            </style>

游리 Multiple <div> elements

    You can have many <div> containers on the same page.

    For example:

        <div>
            <h2>London</h2>
            <p>London is the capital city of England.</p>
            <p>London has over 13 million inhabitants.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Oslo</h2>
            <p>Oslo is the capital city of Norway.</p>
            <p>Oslo has over 600.000 inhabitants.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Rome</h2>
            <p>Rome is the capital city of Italy.</p>
            <p>Rome has almost 3 million inhabitants.</p>
        </div>

游리 Aligning <div> elements side by side

    游댖When building web pages, you often want to have two or more <div> elements side by side.
    游댖There are different methods for aligning elements side by side, all 
    include some CSS styling. We will look at the most common methods:

游리 Float

    游댖The CSS float property was not originally meant to align <div> elements 
    side-by-side, but has been used for this purpose for many years.
    游댖The CSS float property is used for positioning and formatting content 
    and allow elements float next to each other instead of on top of each other.

    For example:

        <style>
            .mycontainer {
                width:100%;
                overflow:auto;
            }
            .mycontainer div {
                width:33%;
                float:left;
            }
        </style>

游리 Inline-block

    If you change the <div> element's display property from block to inline-block, 
    the <div> elements will no longer add a line break before and after, and will 
    be displayed side by side instead of on top of each other.

    For example:    

        <style>
            div {
                width: 30%;
                display: inline-block;
            }
        </style>

游리 Flex

    游댖The CSS Flexbox Layout Module was introduced to make it easier to design 
    flexible responsive layout structure without using float or positioning.
    游댖To make the CSS flex method work, surround the <div> elements with another 
    <div> element and give it the status as a flex container.

    For example:

        <style>
            .mycontainer {
                display: flex;
            }
            .mycontainer > div {
                width:33%;
            }
        </style>

游리 Grid

    游댖The CSS Grid Layout Module offers a grid-based layout system, with rows 
    and columns, making it easier to design web pages without having to use 
    floats and positioning.
    游댖Sounds almost the same as flex, but has the ability to define more 
    than one row and position each row individually.
    游댖The CSS grid method requires that you surround the <div> elements with 
    another <div> element and give the status as a grid container, and you 
    must specify the width of each column.

        For example:

            <style>
                .grid-container {
                    display: grid;
                    grid-template-columns: 33% 33% 33%;
                }
            </style>
