游리 What is Multimedia?

    游댖Multimedia comes in many different formats. It can be almost anything you can hear or see, 
    like images, music, sound, videos, records, films, animations, and more.

    游댖Web pages often contain multimedia elements of different types and formats.
    

游리 Multimedia Formats

    游댖Multimedia elements (like audio or video) are stored in media files.
    游댖The most common way to discover the type of a file, is to look at the file extension.
    游댖Multimedia files have formats and different extensions like: .wav, .mp3, .mp4, .mpg, .wmv, and .avi.

游리 HTML Video

    The HTML <video> element is used to show a video on a web page.

游리 The HTML <video> Element

    To show a video in HTML, use the <video> element:

    For example:

        <video width="320" height="240" controls>
            <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
            <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg">
        </video>

游리 How it Works

    游댖The controls attribute adds video controls, like play, pause, and volume.

    游댖It is a good idea to always include width and height attributes. If height and width are 
    not set, the page might flicker while the video loads.

    游댖The <source> element allows you to specify alternative video files which the browser may 
    choose from. The browser will use the first recognized format.

    游댖The text between the <video> and </video> tags will only be displayed in browsers that do 
    not support the <video> element.

游리 HTML <video> Autoplay

    To start a video automatically, use the autoplay attribute:

    For example

        <video width="320" height="240" autoplay>
            <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
            <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg">
        </video>

游댮 Note: Chromium browsers do not allow autoplay in most cases. However, muted autoplay is always allowed.

    Add muted after autoplay to let your video start playing automatically (but muted):

    For example

        <video width="320" height="240" autoplay muted>
            <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
            <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg">
        </video>

游리 HTML YouTube Videos 

    The easiest way to play videos in HTML, is to use YouTube.

游리 Struggling with Video Formats?

    Converting videos to different formats can be difficult and time-consuming.

    An easier solution is to let YouTube play the videos in your web page.

游리 YouTube Video Id

    YouTube will display an id (like tgbNymZ7vqY), when you save (or play) a video.

    You can use this id, and refer to your video in the HTML code.

游리 Playing a YouTube Video in HTML
    
    To play your video on a web page, do the following:

        Upload the video to YouTube
        Take a note of the video id
        Define an <iframe> element in your web page
        Let the src attribute point to the video URL
        Use the width and height attributes to specify the dimension of the player
        Add any other parameters to the URL (see below)
        
        For example:

            <iframe width="420" height="315"
            src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tgbNymZ7vqY">
            </iframe>

游리 YouTube Autoplay + Mute
    
    You can let your video start playing automatically when a user visits the page, by adding 
    autoplay=1 to the YouTube URL. However, automatically starting a video is annoying for your visitors!

游댮 Note: Chromium browsers do not allow autoplay in most cases. However, muted autoplay is always allowed.

    Add mute=1 after autoplay=1 to let your video start playing automatically (but muted).
